- when the fridge is empty the count will not go below 0 (done)
- verify item has been added to fridge (done)
- only items in fridge can be removed from fridge (done)
- verify string confirmation that item cannot be removed if not in fridge (done)
- working out time left on item before expiry
- opening the fridge and how it affects all items in fridge
- display formatted listing of items with expiry information, ordered by expiry(in progress/commented)
- signal door has been opened (done)
- signal door has been closed (done)
- when the door is opened the expiry of all items is reduced by 1 hour or 5 hours depending on condition
